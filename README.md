maximize points:

 Two teams are playing a game of tennis. The team sizes are the same and each player from the first team plays against the corresponding player from the second team.

  Each player has a certain power level. If a player has a higher power level than her opponent, she is guaranteed to win and her team would get 1 point for that win while the opponents get a 0.

You are the coach of the first team and you know the power levels of all the players before the game starts. You want to rearrange the players in your team to earn the highest possible total score.
